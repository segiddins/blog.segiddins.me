Little would I know that a late Saturday night (that quickly turned into Sunday morning after I returned from a party) spent hacking on some Ruby would forever change the course of history. Well, maybe not <em>history</em>, but certainly my own story, and that of CocoaPods.</p>



<p>I’ve been a <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a> user since the spring of 2013, my <a href="https://github.com/segiddins/RandomRainbow">formative days as an iOS developer</a>, before I even knew how to write a coherent program in Ruby. I couldn’t tell you who had written CocoaPods, whether it was sponsored by a corporation, or whether it would be around in a year, but from day 1 I was heavily indebted to it. I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to say that, without CocoaPods, I could not have made it as an iOS developer.</p>

<p>The first time I was ever forced to consider the idea that CocoaPods was a concrete thing, a human production, was when I saw the announcement on the CocoaPods blog of the <a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Bug-Bash/">Bug Bash</a>. It was set for my last day of my very first college spring break, but I didn’t have anything better to do (I had been sidelined by two removed wisdom teeth earlier in the week), so I hopped on Metro North towards Manhattan, and Artsy HQ.</p>

<p>Not knowing whom I would meet, I took the elevator up to the 27th floor, and was promptly greeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a>. I sat down next to maybe five or six other people, and proceeded to triage issues. If memory serves, I had attended to the second-most issues that weekend, after <a href="https://twitter.com/neonacho">Boris</a> (hence his nickname, the <a href="https://cocoapods.org/about#team">Triagemaster General</a>). I tried making <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1948">one small fix to the specs</a>, but it was really off-base, and I closed the pull request after a few minutes. Other than that, I had contributed no actual code to CocoaPods, but in trying to track down some of the issues, I learned a bit about CocoaPods worked internally. Even more importantly, however, I’d met Orta, along with chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/alloy">Eloy</a>, Fabio, and <a href="https://twitter.com/kylefuller">Kyle</a> over IRC. It was a fun day, but still, it was no harbinger of the year to come. But it was a start.</p>

<p>I returned to the University of Chicago to begin spring quarter of my first year (where I currently plan on completing a triple major). While the first week of the quarter was filled with the obligatory reading, writing, and problem sets, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a bit bored. So, I did what every nineteen year old college student does when bored on a Saturday night: <code>git clone &amp;&amp; bundle install &amp;&amp; vim .</code>. (Ok, maybe that isn’t the typical response, but bear with me.) I decided, in my naivety, to try and rewrite the CocoaPods dependency resolver, because I knew there was an outstanding issue to that effect.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2039">That first PR</a> seemed to get peoples’ attention. I had blindly copy-pasted most of the code from Bundler’s old resolver, but I had some of the basic CocoaPods specs passing. I also got 100 comments from HoundCI, complaining (rather prematurely) about code style. Right after that, I started to seriously talk with Fabio and Eloy about what would be needed to clean up that work and get it mergeable. Days of conversation ensued, in which I didn’t make any progress on the resolver, but I did manage to sneak in about a PR a day doing small things around the different CocoaPods repos. After a couple weeks of that, I had become a member of the <a href="https://cocoapods.org/about#team">core team</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of April, Eloy pointed me towards <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat">Stripe’s announcement of their open source retreat</a>. I’d been working on CocoaPods less than a month, but I was the member of the team most able to drop everything and move to San Fransisco. We had no idea what my proposal would actually promise, but I began to seriously consider taking the plunge and working on CocoaPods full-time. It took a full month to convince my dad to let me take a year off, but I convinced him just before flying out to SF for <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/news/2014/07/02/rubymotion-inspect-2014-wrap-up.html">RubyMotion#inspect</a> (and to meet the majority of the CocoaPods team). In between talks, Eloy and I polished up my proposal, and narrowed it down to one point: a new dependency resolver, potentially to be shared with bundler. And so I submitted the proposal right when I got back to school on May 30. (I took a redeye back and accidentally slept through both my classes that day. Oops.) I wasn’t sure what to expect. On one hand, I was affiliated with a relatively well-known project that had traction in the community. But on the other hand, I was a relative unknown, a random college student with no real track record of open source leadership.</p>

<p>On June 3, 1:22 AM Chicago time, I heard back from Greg Brockman &ndash; I was a finalist. He wanted to schedule a Skype call for later that day. We chatted for about half an hour, and I felt like I hadn’t made a total fool of myself. I settled back into nervous waiting. That night, at 7:07 PM, I had my response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Samuel,</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re in!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so a new chapter of my CocoaPods career began: <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-grantees">I was the soon-to-be grantee</a>. The night I found out happened to be the night before my last day of classes for the year, so after telling everyone and anyone I could call, I celebrated a bit in between juggling my final assignments and my last analysis p-set. I then had to go about preparing to take a year’s leave of absence while also writing papers and studying for finals (and eventually breaking up with my girlfriend).</p>

<p>Over the summer, I was an intern on the iOS team at Tumblr. While I was using CocoaPods on a daily basis at work, development on the tool itself had ground to a halt, both from me and everyone else. I managed to get in the odd pull request or two after work, but I didn’t focus much time on CocoaPods development. That all changed the day I moved to California, September 4th. I had one weekend to acclimate myself (and find an apartment) before starting the three-month retreat at Stripe.</p>

<p>My first day at Stripe was spent triaging upwards of 200 issues, which was an exhausting, yet incredibly productive way to start. On day two, I dug into my work on the dependency resolution algorithm. Later that week, Eloy, Kyle, and myself started to pull together the initial 0.34 release, which was a day-long Herculean effort. At the end of it, though, I finally felt like I belonged on the CocoaPods team.</p>

<p>So I hunkered down to work on the resolver, along with general CocoaPods improvements, for a solid month and a half. Other than a little fire I had to put out while sitting in SFO, things went very smoothly. <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo">Molinillo</a> was born and integrated into CocoaPods, tests were written, and <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2637">my integration PR</a> was merged. The <code>segiddins</code> release was a go.</p>

<p>Since Stripe, I’ve been working at <a href="http://realm.io">Realm</a>. But I’ve also been writing a bunch of CocoaPods code, as well as diving head-first into both <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler">Bundler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RubyGems/RubyGems">RubyGems</a>, spearheaded by Molinillo. I helped review Marius’ work bringing framework (and Swift) support to CocoaPods, along with prodding along the 0.36 release process. I built pod downloading caching and concurrent pod downloads. I’ve fixed a bunch of bugs (and introduced more than I’m proud to admit).</p>

<hr>

<p>So, what does the future hold for me and CocoaPods? Right now, I don’t foresee any changes in the near future. I’ll continue working on some big stuff (the new <code>Podfile</code> DSL comes to mind), and hacking on things behind the scenes. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine not working on CocoaPods now. It’s become a huge part of my life, both professionally and personally, and I’d miss it dearly if I weren’t committing to it every week.</p>

<p>Pod on.</p>
