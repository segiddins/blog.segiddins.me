Years ago, this was my happy place. Flying somewhere, leaving some place, being treated like someone special because I spent so much damn time and dollars for the right to sit on an airplane as it took me from point A to point B.</p>

<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ve been a United 1K for half a decade at this point. Racked up almost half a million millions flown in the past 6 years. But it was more than that. I was a <strong>frequent flier</strong>, damnit. I could navigate airports with my eyes closed, could tell you the best seat on every plane in UA&rsquo;s fleet. Hell, I called United Airlines &ldquo;UA&rdquo;, because that showed how much of an insider I was.</p>

<p>Now, we&rsquo;re several years and one giant global pandemic later. The world&rsquo;s been turned on its head so many times over the past two and a half years, I can&rsquo;t even remember if it&rsquo;s currently upside-down or rightside-up. And here I am, sitting in seat 10F (have booked 10D, don&rsquo;t ask questions), having consumed my in-flight freebies, and &hellip;&hellip; it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>

<p>Shocker.</p>



<p>Flying was my personality. It was my schtick. &ldquo;I spent a night in the Singapore airport working, and downing an entire bottle of champagne while sitting alone in the business class lounge&rdquo; was not only a true statement, but a point of pride. It was how I introduced myself. It was my dating app profile. &ldquo;I took a spring break in Hong Kong just to eat dumplings&rdquo; was true. And I fucking loved that spring break!</p>

<p>And here I am, having flown SFO-NYC two weekends in a row for two different weddings. The travel used to be part of the fun. Enjoying the journey as much as the destination. You know the cliches. But, at least for a lot of the travel I&rsquo;ve done this year, that&rsquo;s been gone. Few upgrades. Chaos in airports. Ticket prices doubling verses the baselines I had memorized. Seatmates not wearing masks. Middle seats having people in them. My favorite flight times no longer on the schedule.</p>

<p>The spontaneity is gone. The absurd is gone. Chasing the sun in a lie-flat seat is&hellip; gone. The last trip I had scheduled, before the world shut down, was supposed to be vacationing in Sicily with my mom. Of course, I was going to get to Italy from San Francisco via Toronto, Mumbai, and Geneva. I loved it. Arbitrage opportunities for earning status, a silly amount of time spent in business class, just being <em>absurd</em> about flying. Saying &ldquo;sign me up&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t cover it &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t need convincing. I sought it out. And me being me, I consistently found it.</p>

<p>And now&hellip; who knows if I can do that again. Remote work makes it harder to just disappear for a conference and say it&rsquo;s all work (yes, it is all work); now I&rsquo;m expected to be on Zoom and Slack constantly, even if I&rsquo;m 9 time zones away and just spent 20 hours in transit. That&rsquo;s not relaxing. It&rsquo;s also not conducive to randomly finding Michelin star restaurants in <em>insert city here</em> to walk into for lunch. Besides, half the places I loved to do that in have been off limits until the past few weeks.</p>

<p>To top it all off, for whatever reason I have utterly failed at taking time off the past few years. Yeah, I was bad before. But now? Why take a day off to ski when I can take meetings from the slopes. Why take an extra day when going to a conference when I can be home in time to open my laptop and call into sprint planning? Seriously, why???</p>

<p>So, to tie it all into the title that I penned in my mind before opening my laptop, I think I&rsquo;m nostalgic for a life I had. I&rsquo;m fighting internally against the idea of giving up on being the jetsetter, the mile-chaser, the guy who flew a bunch and fucking loved it. Because I loved it. I want to find a way to recapture that love of showing up to SFO hours early for a transcon to get a free meal and drink in the lounge, or spending a weekday going out of my way to LAX or IAH to secure double-digit hours in a business class seat upgraded with PlusPoints. That shit was so fucking fun!</p>

<p>Do I know how I&rsquo;m going to go back to it? No. But I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>
